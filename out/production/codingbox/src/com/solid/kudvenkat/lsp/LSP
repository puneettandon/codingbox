Liskov Substitution Principle

S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with the objects of type S

Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types

LSP is a particular definition of subtyping relation, called (Strong) behavioral subtyping


Implementation Guidelines

 No new exception can be thrown by the subtype
 Clients should not know which specific  subtype they are calling
 New derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes
