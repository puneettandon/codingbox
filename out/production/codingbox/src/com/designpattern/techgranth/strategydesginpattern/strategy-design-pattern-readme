Strategy Design Pattern

Requirements

-> Our Application should display video
-> Video can be displayed in various devices
-> Videos can be of different resolution
-> Combination of resolution and device should be picked at run time


Strategy Design Pattern

-> It is behavioral design pattern
-> Uses the power of Run Time Polymorphism of OOPs programming
-> It lets you define multiple algorithm and choose one of them at run time
-> Here we can define multiple algorithm and an entry object
-> Behavior of entry object will be based on the algorithm it selects at runtime
-> In our example VideoPlayer is the entry object
