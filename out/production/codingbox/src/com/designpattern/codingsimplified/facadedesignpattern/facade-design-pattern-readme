Facade Design Pattern

Properties
-> Structural Design pattern
-> Used when there are multiple interfaces of similar kind of jobs, then we add a facade interface,
which provide better interface to these interfaces and clients. It basically help in
routing to related interface.
i.e. Drivers , Databases

Implementation
-> We will implement a facade helper class, which will route to method related to specific class based on input
