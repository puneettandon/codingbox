Fly Weight Design Pattern

Structural Design Pattern

Properties:
-> Used when we need to create many object of a class. We use it to reduce object creation of object.
-> Intrinsic properties : which are same for a object.
-> Extrinsic properties : which are different for a object.

Implementation:
-> Interface: which contains common method: Employee
-> Object: Individual Class: Developer, Tester
-> Intrinsic Property (Developer : fix the issue, Tester : test the issue)
-> Extrinsic Property : Skills
-> We use Factory to use return Object: EmployeeFactory
-> Client: Client class
-> We will assign issues as per skills
