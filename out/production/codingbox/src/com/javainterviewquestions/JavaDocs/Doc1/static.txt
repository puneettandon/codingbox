			static

The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly.

We can apply java static keyword with variables,methods,blocks and nested class. 

The static can be:
1. variable (also known as a class variable)
2. method (also known as a class method)
3. Block
4. Nested class

--------1) Java static variable
If you declare any variable as static, it is known as static variable.
The static variable can used to refer to common property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), for example the company name of employees, etc..........

The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.


java static property is shared to all objects.

program of the counter without static variable
class Counter{

int count = 0;	// will get memory each time when instance is created
// static int count = 0;

Counter(){ count++;  SOP(count);   }
psvm(){ Counter c1 = new Counter();  
	Counter c2 = new Counter();
        Counter c3 = new Counter();    }

output: 
without static       with static
1			1
1			2
1			3

-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Java static method
If you apply static keyword with any method,it is known as static method.
A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
A static method can access static data member and can change value of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Restrictions for static method
1. The static method cannot use non static member or non static mehtod directly.
2. this and super cannot be used in static context

class A{
int a= 40;// non static
psvm(){	SOP(a);}}

output: Compile time error

Why is the java main method static?

Object is not required to call static method.If it were non-static ,JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead to problem of extra memory allocation.

--------------------------------------------------------------

		Java Static block
It is used to initialize the static data member
It is executed before the main method at the time of class loading.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 Can we execute a program without main() method?
Ans) No, one of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a java class without the main method.

class A3{  
  static{  
  System.out.println("static block is invoked");  
  System.exit(0);  
  }  
}  
output: 
static block is invoked


Since JDK 1.7 and above, output would be:

Error: Main method not found in class A3, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
