				Constructor 
Constructor is a special method of every java class which is used to initialize class object with some default values.

It is called when an instance of class is created. 
At the time of calling constructor,memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

It doesn't require return type.
It can be overloaded but with diff. parameters.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such a case, Java compiler provides default constructor by default. 

There are two types of constructors : No-arg constructor and parameterized constructor. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rules for  creating java constructor 
1. Constructor name must be same as its class name.
2. A constructor must have no explicit return type.
3. A java constructor cannot be abstract,static,final,and synchronized.


Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor. It controls the object creation. In other words , we can have private,protected,public or default constructor in java.

------------------------------------------------------------

Types of Java Constructors: 
	Default (no-arg)
	Parameterized 


Syntax: 

<class-name>(){}

Rule: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

class Bike{          				class Bike{
			
		->	compiler	-> 		Bike()	
}						}


What is the purpose of default constructor ?
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0,null,etc depending the type.


---------------------------------------------------------

Constructor Overloading 

There can be more than one constructor different paramenter list.
They are differentiad by the compiler by the number of parameters in  the list and their types.

Java Copy Constructor

There is no copy constructor in java.However, we can copy the values from one object to another like copy constructor in C++.
There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in java.They are:

1) By constructor
2) By assigning values of one object into another
3) By clone() method of object class

Copy the values of one object into another using java constructor:
class Student{
int id; String name;

Student(int i ,String n) { id = i;  name = n; }
Student(Student s){   id = s.id;   name = s.name; }
void display() {  SOP(id + " " + name);
psvm(){
 Student s1 = new Student(111,"Puneet");
 Student s2 = new Student(s1);
s1.display(); 	s2.display();
}


Copying values without construtor: 

s2.id = s1.id;
s2.name = s1.name;
------------------------------------------------------------

Does constructor return any value?

Yes,it is the current class instance
