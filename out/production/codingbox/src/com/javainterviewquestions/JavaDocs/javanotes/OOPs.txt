Object -  Any entity that has state(features and attributes) and behaviour(methods).
	  Ex - table,chair,pen,laptop, etc 
	  Can be physical or logical.

	  An object consists of : 
		1. State (properties of an object)
		2. Behaviour (methods of an object)
		3. Identity (unique name to an object)

	  Example of an object: dog

	   Identity : Name of dog
	   State : Breed,Age,Color
	   Behaviour : Bark,Sleep,Eat 
		
	   An object can be defined as an instance of a class.



Class - Collection of objects is called class. 
	It is a logical entity.
	A class is a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
	It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.




			Inheritance 
- Mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.
- Code reusability
- Runtime polymorphism

   Important terminology:
	Super class - The class whose features are inherited is known as super class.
	Sub class - The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class. The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

  -Keyword for inheritance is - extends

	class derived-class extends base-class
	{
		//methods and fields
	}

   - In practice, inheritance and polymorphism are used together in java to achieve fast performance and readability of code.

	
		Type of Inheritance in java
                   
1. Single Inh -  class A , class B ext A

2. Mulitlevel Inh - class A, class B ext A ,class C ext B

3. Hierarchical Inh -  class A , class B ext A ,
 		       class C ext A, class D ext A

4. Multiple Inh - class A , class B , class C ext A,B (in java not supported in classes) supported through interfaces
