1. Runtime engine to run java applications.
2. Calls main method.
3. Part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment)

4. Java applications are called WORA( Write Once Run Anywhere) ....possible beacuse of JVM

Explanation: 
	- When we compile a .java file, .class files(contain byte-code) with same class names present in .java file are generated by the java compiler.
	- This .class file goes into various steps when we run it.These steps together describe the whole JVM.

      Execution engine -> Native method Interface  -> Native method libraries



Class Loader Substem

    Responsible for 3 Activities: 
	 1. Loading
	 2. Linking
