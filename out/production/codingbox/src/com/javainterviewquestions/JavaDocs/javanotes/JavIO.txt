				Java I/O 


Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
Ability of connecting program with input and output
Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast.
We can perform file handling in java by Java I/O API.

Stream - A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes.

In java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.

1. System.out: output
2. System.in: input
3. System.err: error
