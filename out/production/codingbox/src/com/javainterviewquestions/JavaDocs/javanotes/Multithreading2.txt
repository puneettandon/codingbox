What is a Program?
   > Collection of instructions written by programmers in a programming language stored in non-volatile memory(secondary storage devices like hard disk ,optical disk etc).


What is a Process? 
	> Program under execution 


	

	   Program1
          stored in 
	secondary storage 
	    device

when we start our application in our system, our OS loads the that program(program1) in our main/primary memory(RAM). 
Executing any program directly from secondary storage device takes a huge amount of time.
So when OS brings the program into main memory it converts into a process(Process1).



Process Memory


Process memory consists of different parts

	Meta data of Process 		 	-     PCB
	contains processId , process status,program counter 
	and other general purpose registers.this data is  required to 
	maintain scheduling of the processes.

	Track of active subroutine and/or other events		- Stack
	stores functions calls, also stores local variables 
	and its grows downwards towards heap

	Intermediate computation data generated during run time  -  Heap	
	This heap size keep growing upwards acc to need.

	Program's global variables and static variables   - Global/Static Variables

	An image of the executable machine code associated with a program   -  code
	( we write code in High level language code understandable by humans but need to be converted to Low Level Language(which is binary or machine language) to be execute by CPU). This conversion from HLL to LLL is done by compiler.

What is MultiProgramming? 

The main idea of multiprogramming is to minimize the wastage of CPU Time.CPU should not remain idle.

Let say we have Secondary Storage Device(SSD)    CPU     Main memory

Then we have some programs in our  SSD  - program1 ,program2 , program3 ......


To execute the program OS need to load it to main memory ..........
At any time CPU can execute the instruction of only one process.
like Process1 is under execution.
Then Program2 and program 3 also  loaded into main memory. .........
Now Process2 and Process3 are waiting for CPU time.

Now suppose process needs to perform some I/O operation. So at this time CPU is idle.
this is wastage of CPU time.
Therefore by multiprogramming concept , OS can interrupt this process1 and fetch either n processes to be executed and utilize the cpu time.
So Process2 can be executed at this time.
In multiprogramming, process keeps executing until it is completed or it voluntarily releases the CPU(for executing I/O or any other operation).


---------------------------------------


What is MultiTasking?

small diff b/w Multiprogramming and Multitasking 
Every process will run for some quantum of time.
Process1 is under execution for time quantum period. 
There are different algorithms for this 
like round robin

Acc. to round robin which program loaded first will be executed first
like Process1 then Process2 then Process3 
after a quantum Process1 is saved back into main memory
and process2 will be executed

This is called context switching this is done by OS.

Different algorithms are there which to execute first .................


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is Multiprocessing?

 Refers to hardware ...when we are using mulitple CPU units.

here we can have multiple processes running at the same time.
This enables parallel processing.

Context Switching : Switch CPU to another process


Steps to switch the CPU to another process

Process1		Process2 
(running)		 |
  |			 |
 save 			Fetch

	context switching - time taken to switch from one process to another
	     time
1.Save the current process's context to be restored at later time.
2. Fetch the next scheduled process's context


--------------------------------------------------------------------


Inter Process Communication : Allows Exchange of data and information between processes

Many a times processes have to communicate to complete some task
This communication can be done by 
1. Shared Memory
2. Message Passing


---------------------------------------------------------

MulitThreading

Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.
Threads use a shared memory area.
They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory,and context switching between the threads takes less time than process.
