Batch
-> Ad-hoc Scheduled processing
-> Collection of data



Stream
-> Real time processing
-> Continuous data


Micro-Batch ( mix of Batch and Stream)
-> Collection of data & processing continuously in short span of time

----------------------------------

When to use Batch Processing....

Files
EOD(End of Day)  feeds

Can use big-data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop.
They will parse the files , process them , transform into some format and store into databases.
These database could be hive, or hadoop hdfs .


When to use Stream Processing....

Multiple applications tries to publish into kafka topic ( information could be anything like accessibility information)
Kafka topic uses different tools like apache flink or apache storm ....to consume these messages real time and processed
into data store.

Use Case : Analytics Application - Imaginary
Similar to Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics
