Problem Statement

We have to do low level design for a cache system.Cache that we will design will have to support 2 operations:

    1. Put: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
    2. Get: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
    3. Eviction: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full and we try to
       add new key value.
