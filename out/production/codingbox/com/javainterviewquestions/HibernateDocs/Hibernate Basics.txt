			Hibernate 

- An ORM tool 
- Used in the data layer of the applications to persist application data into database
- Implements JPA


----------------------------------------------------------------

		The Problem hibernate is trying to solve - 

User Class
ID
Name 
Address
Phone 
Date of Birth

5 users object  in memory

Data table - for all user class fields 

	Table User - corresponds to class Name 	
	ID 	Name 	Address	  Phone   DOB

columns corresponds to fields of User class 

Object at class level but not at table or database level

So we class fields needs to be converted to columns 
And the way we convert is by using some boilerplate code.
Which takes value each of these properties and maps it to SQL query
So need to convert each object to SQL query for saving 
and fetching we have to convert each record set into object.

--------------------------------------------------------------  

	The Problem 

- Mapping member variables to columns 	
- Mapping Relationship ( user object has reference of Address object)
- Handling data types (eg. converting boolean to char or boolean to integer as database don't have boolean datatype)
- Managing changes to object state

	Object 					Relational	
			Mapping


maps gap b/w object and tables
