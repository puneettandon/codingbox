Robust:  1. Memory Management, 
	 2. Automatic Garbage Collection,  
	 3. Exception Handling mechanism
	 4. Lack of pointers


Secured: 1. No Explicit pointer
	 2. Java has its own JVM(own Runtime environment)
	 3. Classloader(part of jre which is used to load java classes into the java virtual machine dynamically)
	 4. Bytecodoe Verifier(checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right to objects)
	 5. Security Manager(determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk)


Architectural-neutral: java is architectural neutral because 


Simple: 1. Easy to learn
	2. Simple syntax
	

Object-oriented: 1. Everthing in java is an object.
		 2. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.


Platform Independent: 1. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. Bytecode platform independent 

Dynamic: Java is a dynamic language.
