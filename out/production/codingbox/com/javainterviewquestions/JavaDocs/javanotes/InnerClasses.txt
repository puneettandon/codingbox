		Java Inner Classes

Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.

we use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.

Additionally,it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.


	Syntax of Inner class

class Java_Outer_class{

	// code
	class Java_Inner_class{
		// code
	}
}

	
	Advantage of java inner classes 

1) Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members(data members and methods) of outer class including private.
2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and and interfaces in one place only.
3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.



Types of Nested classes 


Non-static nested class
	1. Member inner class- A class created within class and outside method.
	2. Anonymous inner class - A class created for implementing interface or extending class.Its name is decided by java compiler.
	3. Local inner class - A class created within method.

Static nested class - A static class created within class.

Nested interface - An interface created within class or interface.

		Java Member inner class (Non static inner class)


A non-static class that is created inside a class but outside the method is called member inner class.

syntax: 

class Outer{
	// code 
	class Inner{

	}
}
