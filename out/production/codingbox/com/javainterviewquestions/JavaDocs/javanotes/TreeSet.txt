			TreeSet

TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in java that uses a tree for storage.

The ordering of the elements is maintained by a set using their natural ordering whether or not an explicit comparator is provided.

This must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface. 
It can also be ordered by a comparator provided at set creation time.

TreeSet implements the SortedSet interface so duplicate values are not allowed.
Objects in a TreeSet are stored in sorted and ascending order.
TreeSet does not preserve the insertion order of elements but elements are sorted by keys.
TreeSet does not allow to insert Heterogenous objects. It will throw ClassCastException at runtime if trying to add heterogenous objects.
TreeSet serves as an excellent choice for storing large amounts of sorted informatiion which are supposed to be accessed quickly because of its faster access and retrieval time.

Firstly,insertion of null into a TreeSet throws NullPointerException because while insertion of null ,gets compared to the existing elements and null cannot be compared to any value.

TreeSet class internally uses TreeMap to store elements.
