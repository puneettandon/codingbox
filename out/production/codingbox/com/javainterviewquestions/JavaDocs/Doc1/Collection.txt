			Collections

A Collection in java is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit.
Java provides Collections framework which defines several classes and interfaces to represent a group of objects as a single unit.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching ,sorting ,insertion, manipulation and deletion.

Why we group up objects?

1. Suppose when we issue a query to database, then in response to query a lot of objects may come.....to java application as a result.

To store these objects we can use array but as we know array are fixed in size ......so in such a situation we require java collection.

2. Suppose we want to pass n number of objects of similar type to a method then first 

Before Collection framework(or before JDK1.2) was introduced,the standard methods for grouping java objects(or collections) were Arrays or Vectors or Hashtables. All of these collections had no common interface.

	  HashSet(C)        ArrayList(C)    PriorityQueue(C)
	  LinkedHashSet(C)  LinkedList(C)   Deque(I)
                            Vector(C)           
         SortedSet(I)         Stack(C)
           TreeSet(C)
