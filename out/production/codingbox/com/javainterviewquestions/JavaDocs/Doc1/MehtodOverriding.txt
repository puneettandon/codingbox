			Method Overriding

It occurs when a derived class has a definiton for one of the member functions of the base class.That base function is said to be overriden.

If subclass has the same method class as declared in the parent class,it is known as method overriding in java.

or 
If a child class provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of the parent class, it is known as method overriding.

- use to achieve runtime polymorphism.

-----------------
	Rules

1. method must have the same name as in the parent class.
2. method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. must be as IS-A relationship(inheritance).

Example: 
 
class Vehicle
{
	void run(){}
}
class Bike extends Vehicle
{
	void run(){}	//provides specific implementation
}

-----------------------------------------------

Can we override static method?
No, static method cannot be overriden. we can declare static methods with same signature in subclass,but it is not considered overriding as there won't be any run-time polymorphism.
If a derived class defined a static method with same signature as static method in base class, the method in the derived class hides the method in the base class.

-------------------------

In a subclass ,we can overload the methods inherited from the superclass.
