Design Pattern to be used - Chain of Responsibility

- It is a behavioral design pattern
- Decision making is sequential
- On each step there is an object which decides, it request needs to be moved ahead in the chain or
  response should be sent back from that step
- Decision to be made at each step, and the processing logic is decoupled from each other.
- It seems like decorator pattern but the biggest difference is, Decorator being a structural pattern, it
  adds some responsibility to existing object where as COR pattern,each object in the chain performs it's own
  responsibility, irrespective of what was/is happening before and after in the chain.
