Notification Service

Requirements

Notification Service should be decoupled from main application
Service should support multiple types of notification like text message or QR code
Service should support multiple ways of sending notifications like text,email or whatsapp
Each type can have it's own processor
Processors should not be tightly coupled as in future we may need to support additional ways like telegram message


Scale service in event of high traffic to application
Reduce service downtime
Load balance and distribute processing


Bridge Design Pattern
    Decouple abstraction from it's implementation
    Helpful when class and what the class does both varies a lot
    In our case,notification can be as text, email or whatsapp
    The way you send text,email or whatsapp are all different
    So what bridge design pattern does is, create BRIDGE between abstraction and it's implementation


Why Bridge pattern was chosen for this example
    Since service supports multiple types of notifications
    Eacht type can be implemented in multile ways, based on where to send the message
    Seems like we need to create N * M classes where N = number of types , M = number of ways
    Bridge pattern to rescue , just create N + M classes



Abstraction in Message Processor
    Type of message
        1. Text
        2. QR

Implementation in Message Processor
    Ways to send message
        SMS
        EMAIL
        Whatsapp
