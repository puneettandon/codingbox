Cab Booking Problem

Problem Statement:
We want to build a cab booking platform to allow a rider to book a cab.

Details:
    - The location is represented as a (x,y) coordinate.
    - Distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
    - The platform has decided upon maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.
    - A cab has only 1 driver.
    - Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders
    - There is single type of cab

Please build an application that exposed following features to riders and drivers

    - Register a driver
    - Register a driver/cab
    - Update a cab's location
    - A driver can switch on/off his availability
    - A rider can book a cab
    - Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider
    - End the trip

Expectation from this round

    - Demonstrate code is first expectation. To do this, you can choose any interface you are comfortable with - CLI, webapp , APIs
    - Code should be extensible
    - Clean professional level code
    - Functional completeness including good modelling
    - User identification but not authentication
    - Backend database is optional. However, modelling should be complete.
