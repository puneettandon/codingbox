TG AdapterDesignPattern

Requirements

-> Should be able to play music/video
-> Must support some default formats
-> Player must be extensible to support new formats in future
-> Adding new format should not have an impact on existing format


Adapter Design Pattern

-> Converts one interface to another
-> Helps in coupling 2 class of incompatible interface
-> Example Old Desktop screen supports only VGA
            New Laptop supports only HDMI
            To connect both screen we need adapter(cable/connect/USB) to connect each other
