Composite Design Pattern

Properties
-> Structural Design Pattern
-> Composite lets client treat individual objects(Leaf) and compositions of objects(object) uniformly
-> Four Participants: Component, Leaf, Composite, Client
-> If object is leaf node, request is handled directly , If object is composite, it forward
request to child, so some operation & combine operations.

Implementation
-> Component : Account class, which contains common method
-> Leaf : DepositAccount & SavingAccount
-> Composite : CompositeAccount
-> Client : Client class
-> we will get balance of all account for a person.
