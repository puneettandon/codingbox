Proxy Design Pattern

Structural Design Pattern

Properties:
-> Used when you want to control access i.e. In databases, you would want to control the delete query available
only for certain users like admin.

Implementation:
-> In general, we have class which is executing interface executer method, which is executing all commands.
-> To control this, we add a proxy, class which implements the same interface and write the conditions for 'admin'
user before proceeding to actual executer.
