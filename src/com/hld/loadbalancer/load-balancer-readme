Load Balancer

What is Load Balancer?
-> A traffic router which distributes request across servers in a cluster
-> It balances the load of website.So let's say whenever you site is too big. So a single node cannot handle the
whole load.so we need many resources.Then we manage load b/w different resources.
-> It helps to distribute load across multiple resources
-> It also keep track of status of all the resources while distributing requests.If a server is not available,
it stops sending traffic.
-> Distribution of requests make sure that none of the servers are loaded
-> Helps in making sure that request does not go to to a dead server
-> Decides which server in the cluster is most suitable for handling any incoming request

Where it can be added
-> Users - web server
-> Web server -  Internal Server
-> Internal Server - Database

Types of Load Balancers
--Hardware  LB:
    -> They are hardware which work as LB, but are very expensive.
    -> Even big companies use them only as first point of contact & use other mechanism for load-balancing
    -> More secure and higher throughput

--Software  LB:
    -> It is a hybrid approach. HAProxy is popular open source software LB.
    -> Every client request on this port(where HAProxy is running ) will be received by proxy & then passed
    to the backend service in efficient way.
    -> HAProxy manages health check & will remove or add machines to those pools.
    -> we should start with these.
    -> Less secure and lesser throughput


Algorithms used for Load Balancing:
-> Round Robin
-> Round Robin with weighted server
-> Least Connections
-> Least Response Time
-> Source IP Hash
-> URL Hash
