Non Functional Requirements

    1. Low Latency
    2. High Availability
    3. High Consistency


 -->Some of the components which are dealing with the payment and inventory counting, they need to be
    highly consistent at the cost of availability
    Components like search they need to be highly available , may be at cost of consistency at times.
    And overall most of the user facing components should have a low latency
